### Create a login request for user that does not exist. Generates a 4768 Event.

```
# PowerShell script to generate Event ID 4768 with result code 0x6
# This script attempts to authenticate with a non-existent username 
# which will generate the desired event in the Security log

# Define a username that doesn't exist in your domain
# Using a random GUID as part of the username to ensure it doesn't exist
$nonExistentUser = "nonexistent_user_" + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString().Substring(0, 8)
$domain = $env:USERDOMAIN
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "AnyPasswordHere" -AsPlainText -Force

Write-Host "Attempting to authenticate with non-existent username: $nonExistentUser@$domain"
Write-Host "This should generate Event ID 4768 with result code 0x6 in the Security log"

try {
    # Attempt to create a credential object with the non-existent username
    $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("$domain\$nonExistentUser", $password)
    
    # Try to authenticate using the credential
    # Using New-PSDrive as it requires authentication but won't cause harm
    New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\$env:COMPUTERNAME\C$" -Credential $credential -ErrorAction Stop
    
    Write-Host "Authentication attempt completed. This should have failed and generated the event."
} 
catch {
    Write-Host "Expected authentication failure occurred: $_"
    Write-Host "The Event ID 4768 with result code 0x6 should now be in the Security log"
}

Write-Host "`nYou can now run your search script to find this event."
Write-Host "Note: It may take a few moments for the event to appear in the logs."
